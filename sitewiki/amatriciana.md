## Ingredients

| Ingredient               | Amount | Amount (US) |
|--------------------------|--------|-------------|
| Bucatini                 | 450g   | 1 lb        |
| Tomato Passata           | 750g   | 3 cups      |
| Pecorino Romano (grated) | 60g    | 2 oz        |
| Guanciale                | 225g   | 8 oz        |
| Dry White Wine           | 60ml   | 0.25 cups   |
| Chili Flakes             | 5g     | 1 tsp       |

## Instructions

1. Clean and dice the guanciale. Aim for fat and meat in each cube.
2. Place guanciale in a cold pan without oil and begin to render with low heat. Rendering should take about 8-10 minutes.
3. Bring large, heavily-salted pot of water to a boil. Maybe 4 cups with a tablespoon of kosher salt.
4. After the guanciale is rendered, add wine and chili flakes. Bring the heat up to medium and let wine evaporate for 3 minutes.
5. Add tomato. Simmer sauce for about 10-12 minutes. Reduction of the sauce is not the goal, as to preserve the acidity of the tomatoes.
6. Boil bucatini 3-4 minutes less than the package instructions.
7. Transfer bucatini directly to the tomato sauce without draining. Add an additional ladle of pasta water.
8. Mix bucatini with the tomato sauce over high heat, working quickly to incorporate without overcooking the noodles. Add half the grated pecorino romano and toss.
9. Serve immediately with additional pecorino romano and pepper.
