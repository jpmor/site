    </blockquote>
    <p><code>- Bourke Cockran</code></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Wilderness is the raw material out of which man has hammered the
      artifact called civilization. Wilderness was never a homogeneous raw
      material. It was very diverse, and the resulting artifacts are very
      diverse. These differences in the end-product are known as cultures. The
      rich diversity of the world’s cultures reflect a corresponding diversity
      in the wilds that gave them birth.</p>

    <p><code>- John Adams</code></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The United States has a long history of failing to preserve civil
      liberties when it perceived its national security threatened. The country
      has remorsefully realized the abrogation of civil liberties was
      unnecessary. But it has proven unable to prevent itself from repeating
      the error when the next crisis came along.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p><code>- General Billy Mitchell</code></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The Grid of New York is the most courageous act of prediction in
      Western civilization: the land it divides, unoccupied, the population it
      describes, conjectural; the buildings it locates, phantoms….</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><code>- Rem Koolhaas</code></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>One cannot dip a toe into the water of New York politics without
      sensing, moving somewhere deep beneath the surface, the presence of an
      enormous force, a power unseen but immense: the power of banks.</p>
